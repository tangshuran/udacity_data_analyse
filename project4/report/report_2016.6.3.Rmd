EmploymentStatus:Employed, Full-time, Not available, Not employed, Other, Part-time, Retired, Self-employed
ProsperRating..Alpha.: AA, A, B, C, D, E, HR


### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
LoanOriginalAmount,IsBorrowerHomeowner,AvailableBankcardCredit,StatedMonthlyIncome,Occupation,EmploymentStatus

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
LoanOriginationDate,Term,MonthlyLoanPayment,BorrowerAPR,LP_ServiceFees,ProsperRating

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?
Yes:
df$LoanOriginalAmount_cut<-cut(df$LoanOriginalAmount,c(0,1000,4000,6500,8500,12000,18000,25000,35000))

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?
I log-transformed the AvailableBankcardCredit. 
```{r}
qplot(x=log10(AvailableBankcardCredit+1),data=subset(df,!is.na(AvailableBankcardCredit)))

setwd("E:/learning_R")

  group_by(Occupation,IsBorrowerHomeowner)%>%
  summarise(mean_Credit=mean(AvailableBankcardCredit),
            mean_income=mean(StatedMonthlyIncome),

# Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?
```{r}
cor.test(df.Credit_and_income_by_Occupation_owner.long$median_income,df.Credit_and_income_by_Occupation_owner.long$mean_Credit)

```
Generally speaking, the loan original Amount tends to be larger as the ProsperRating goes higher.
The loan original amount squeezes a lot when the prosper rating drop from C to D.
The gap between other ratings are not that huge.

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?
The loanee with home ownership generally has a higher credit and state income than the ones without ownership.
The state monthly income of loanees vary a lot among different occupations. Even within the same occupation, the there is huge variance for some particular occupation. Some outlier can reach even 3 or 4 times as the mean income.
### What was the strongest relationship you found?
For a certain occupation, the mean credit and median come are strongly related.
The correlation between them is as high as 0.799.
The loanee has to pay more interests if the loan has a lower ProsperRating.

```

# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?
DebtToIncomeRatio is strongly related to IncomeRange. The people who has the DebtToIncomeRatio higher than 1.25,are mostly in the range of $1-24999 for their income or not employed.
Most people with part-time job have a low IncomeRange. 
For people who have a DebtToIncomeRatio higher than 10, they are all in the range of $1-24999 for their income or not employed.

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?
The Borrower's Annual Percentage Rate is closely related to the ProsperRating of the Loan.
The loan with a higher rating trend to have a lower APR.But the borrower of the low rating loan has to pay more interest for the loan annually.
The interest and fee of most loans are less than 5000.
